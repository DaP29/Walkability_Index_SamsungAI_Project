# Walkability_Index_SamsungAI_Project

**Walkability promotes sustainability and quality of life by encouraging physical activity and removing emissions from the environment**

This repo has data analysis and modeling codes which I compiled as a part of the Samsung AI capstone project.
This project uses the Census Data to predict the walkability index class i.e. walkabale or non-walkable location. https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#walkability 

General approach:
- Data preprocessing included data cleanup and PCA
- Data cleanup involved duplicate removal, one-hot encoding (for Object data), imputing with the mean (for numerical data) and most frequent value (for Object data), and scaling
- PCA retained 24 columns â€“ which explained 95% of variance
